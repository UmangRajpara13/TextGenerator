# TextGeneration

This Project was initially developed to provide an AutoComplete feature for Arrow Terminal. Arrow Console used this model briefly, reading users' bash history to provide suggestions in its autocomplete widget. However, on the basis of UX principles a GUI(mouse-based design) has proven to add more value to users rather than a Keyboard based UI design.
